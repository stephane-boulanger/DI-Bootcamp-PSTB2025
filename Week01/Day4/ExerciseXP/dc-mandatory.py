# Instructions:

# Use the provided Pets and Cat classes to create a Siamese breed, instantiate cat objects, and use the Pets class to manage them.
# See the example below, before diving in.

# Step 1: Create the Siamese Class

# Create a class called Siamese that inherits from the Cat class.
# You can add any specific attributes or methods for the Siamese breed, or leave it as is if there are no unique behaviors.

# Step 2: Create a List of Cat Instances#

# Create a list called all_cats that contains instances of Bengal, Chartreux, and Siamese cats.
# Example: all_cats = [bengal_obj, chartreux_obj, siamese_obj]
# Give each cat a name and age.


# Step 3: Create a Pets Instance

# Create an instance of the Pets class called sara_pets, passing the all_cats list as an argument.


# Step 4: Take Cats for a Walk

# Call the walk() method on the sara_pets instance.
# This should print the result of calling the walk() method on each cat in the list.


# Example:

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())

# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# Step 1: Create the Siamese class

# Step 2: Create a list of cat instances

# Step 3: Create a Pets instance of the list of cat instances

# sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)

# Step 4: Take cats for a walk
# sara_pets.walk()

class Pets:
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animals in self.animals:
            print(animals.walk())


class Cat:
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f"{self.name} is just walking around" 

class Siamese(Cat):
    def sing(self, sound):
        return(f"{sound}")

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sound):
        return(f"{sound}")

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sound):
        return(f"{sound}") 
    
# Etape : Cr√©er les instances de chats

bengal_obj = Bengal("Kira", 5)
chartreux_obj = Chartreux("Chira", 2)
siamese_obj = Siamese("Poupi", 13)

# Etape : Cr√©er la liste de tous les chats

all_cats = [bengal_obj, chartreux_obj, siamese_obj]

sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)

sara_pets.walk()

print()

# üåü Exercise 2: Dogs
# Goal: Create a Dog class with methods for barking, running speed, and fighting.

# Instructions:

# Step 1: Create the Dog Class

# Create a class called Dog with name, age, and weight attributes.
# Implement a bark() method that returns ‚Äú is barking‚Äù.
# Implement a run_speed() method that returns weight / age * 10.
# Implement a fight(other_dog) method that returns a string indicating which dog won the fight, based on run_speed * weight.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking"
    
    def run_speed(self):
        return (self.weight / self.age * 10)
    
    def fight(self, other_dog):
        self.other_dog = other_dog
    
        my_power = self.run_speed() * self.weight

        other_power = other_dog.run_speed() * other_dog.weight  

        if my_power > other_power:
                print(f"{my_dog.name} is the winner!")
        else:
                print(f"{my_dog.name} loose!")
      
# Step 2: Create Dog Instances

# Create three instances of the Dog class with different names, ages, and weights.

my_dog = Dog("Rex", 5, 40)
dog1 = Dog("Sultan", 4, 35)
dog2 = Dog("Mimi", 3, 10)

# Step 3: Test Dog Methods

# Call the bark(), run_speed(), and fight() methods on the dog instances to test their functionality.

print(dog1.bark())

print(dog2.run_speed())

result = my_dog.fight(dog2)

# üåü Exercise 3: Dogs Domesticated
# Goal: Create a PetDog class that inherits from Dog and adds training and tricks.

# Instructions:

# Step 1: Import the Dog Class

# In a new Python file, import the Dog class from the previous exercise.

from dog import Dog
import random

# Step 2: Create the PetDog Class

# Create a class called PetDog that inherits from the Dog class.
# Add a trained attribute to the __init__ method, with a default value of False.
# trained means that the dog is trained to do some tricks.
# Implement a train() method that prints the output of bark() and sets trained to True.
# Implement a play(*args) method that prints ‚Äú all play together‚Äù.
# *args on this method is a list of dog instances.
# Implement a do_a_trick() method that prints a random trick if trained is True.
# Use this list for the ramdom tricks:
# tricks = ["does a barrel roll", "stands on his back legs", "shakes your hand", "plays dead"]
# Choose a rendom index from it each time the method is called.

class PetDog(Dog):
        def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
            super().__init__(name, age, weight)
            self.trained = False

        def train(self): 
            print(self.bark())
            self.trained = True

                dog_names = self.name
                for dog in args:
                     dog_names.append(dog.name)
                all_names = ", ".join(dog_names)
                print(f"{all_names} all play together")

        def do_a_trick(self):

                        tricks = ["does a barrel roll", "stands on his back legs", "shakes your hand", "plays dead"]
                        print(f"{self.name} {random.choice(tricks)}")

# üåü Exercise 4: Family and Person Classes
# Goal:

# Practice working with classes and object interactions by modeling a family and its members.


# Instructions:

# Step 1: Create the Person Class

# Define a Person class with the following attributes:
# first_name
# age
# last_name (string, should be initialized as an empty string)
# Add a method called is_18():
# It should return True if the person is 18 or older, otherwise False.


# Step 2: Create the Family Class

# Define a Family class with:
# A last_name attribute
# A members list that will store Person objects (should be initialized as an empty list)


# Add a method called born(first_name, age):
# It should create a new Person object with the given first name and age.
# It should assign the family‚Äôs last name to the person.
# It should add this new person to the members list.


# Add a method called check_majority(first_name):
# It should search the members list for a person with that first_name.
# If the person exists, call their is_18() method.
# If the person is over 18, print:
# "You are over 18, your parents Jane and John accept that you will go out with your friends"
# Otherwise, print:
# "Sorry, you are not allowed to go out with your friends."


# Add a method called family_presentation():
# It should print the family‚Äôs last name.
# Then, it should print each family member‚Äôs first name and age.


# Expected Behavior:

# Once implemented, your program should allow you to:

# Create a family with a last name.
# Add members to the family using the born() method.
# Use check_majority() to see if someone is allowed to go out.
# Display family information with family_presentation().
# Don‚Äôt forget to test your classes by creating an instance of Family, adding members, and calling each method to see the expected output.
