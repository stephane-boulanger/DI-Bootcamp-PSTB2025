# Given the string "amazing", return a list with all the vowels removed: ["m", "z", "n", "g"].

# Generate a list with the following value: [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]].

# Generate a list with the following structure:

# [
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
